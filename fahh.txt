- Personal Information: We do not ask for or collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.
- Usage Data: We do not track how you use the App.
- Device Information: We do not access or collect device-specific information (e.g., unique device identifiers, IP address).

3. Permissions
The App requires no special permissions to operate. It does not access your camera, microphone, contacts, location, or storage.

4. Third-Party Services
The App does not utilize any third-party services, analytics, or advertising networks that collect data.

5. Data Security
Because we do not collect any data, there is no risk of your data being accessed, lost, or stolen through our App. Your privacy is inherently protected by the App's design.

6. Children's Privacy
Our App is safe for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 or any other age, as we do not collect any data at all.
